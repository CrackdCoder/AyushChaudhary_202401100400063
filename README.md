Air Quality Classification Project This repository provides a Python-based solution for classifying air quality into six levels: Good, Moderate, Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups, Unhealthy, Very Unhealthy, and Hazardous. The project uses environmental features such as PM2.5, NO2, and Temperature to calculate a composite air quality.
